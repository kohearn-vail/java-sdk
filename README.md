### SDK Installation

To include the SDK in your build, follow the instructions on [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#PersephonyAPI/java-sdk)

## Testing your Installation

Test the SDK is working by sending yourself a text message.

```java
public class Example {

    public static final String accountId = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
    public static final String authToken = "your_auth_token";
    public static final String To = "your_phone_number";
    public static final String From = "a_free_climb_phone_number_in_your_account";

    public static void main(String[] args) throws FreeClimbException {
        FreeClimbClient client = new FreeClimbClient(accountId, authToken);

        client.messages.create(From, To, "Welcome to FreeClimb!");
    }
}
```

When you run this code you should get a text message.

### Running Unit Tests

You can run `gradle test` to run the full test suite.

You can also specify cucumber tags with the usual boolean inclusion / exclusion, specific feature files, or the line of the scenario or scenario outline example to run.

```bash
gradle -Dcucumber.options=src/test/resources/com/vailsys/freeclimb/api/call/Call.feature:5 test
```

```bash
gradle -Dcucumber.options="--tags @Calls" test
```

You can generate a Cobertura coverage report by running `gradle cobertura`. The report will be found at build/cobertura.
